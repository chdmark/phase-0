## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

For this section, I created my own website repository, created a new repository, cloned the repository to my computer, learned about different open source licenses, and reinforced git pushing concepts. I am getting more comfortable with the process, but have not fully memorized it. I would say I'm struggling with memorizing the entire process, as I have to "sneak peak" back at the directions from previous sections. In addition, I am becoming more familiar with creating a new feature branch and knowing the differences between the master branch and feature branch. I imagine I will remember and get faster with massive amounts of repition! 

In order to create a repository, you would need to login to your GitHub account. Click the "+" button in the upper right hand corner, and click "New repository." This will redirect you to the new repository page. Name your repository, choose between public and private, and add a license based on your needs. 

After creating a repository, you need to clone your computer for a local copy. First, open the repository you just created on GitHub. Navigate to the "HTTPS clone URL" section in the lower right hand corner. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" link, and the URL you need will be copied to your clipboard. Open up your terminal and "cd" to the directory where you want to clone to. Type "pwd" to make sure you are in your desired directory. Now you are ready to clone the repo! Type "git clone URL_COPIED" Remember to replace URL_COPIED with your unique url you copied from GitHub. Type "ls" and you should see your new repository in your directory! 

Open source software means that anyone can access, redistribute, download, or modify the source coude to the open source software. If a software is labeled as an open source software, it provides universal access to everyone who wants to access the code. Personally, I enjoy the idea of open source because it provides access to people who can make the source code better. A great example is the Cyanogenmod on Android phones. This helped developers create a version of Cyanogen that is specific to a phone. 

It is important to understand licensing in the open source world because of the different licenses avaialble to the public. There is a difference between licensing and open-source licenses. When you license your work to the general public, you do not own the copyright to your work, and people are not required to acknoweledge you as original creator. However, open-source licensing gives you some credit as the original creator, and allows people to contribute to your project without permission. There are different types of open-source licenses. The most popular is the MIT License because it allows people to do whatever they want with the source code as long as they provide it with the license.
