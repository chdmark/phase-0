## 1.1 Think About Time
I learned about many different time management and productivity in the various readings and videos given. The most interesting ideas I learned about were growth mindset, the Pomodoro technique, and different techniques to “getting in the zone.” The growth mindset technique is interesting to me because it theorizes people can develop abilities through effort, good teaching, and persistence. Failure is part of the learning process, and you can use it to help you develop your abilities and become more confident. I enjoy how small, repeated wins can help you develop a growth mindset.  In addition, I really enjoyed how to find your state of flow. “No fear of failure, clear goals, and balancing between challenge and skill” are concepts I’d like to incorporate in my daily routine. Being in the state of flow helps you stay focused, and enjoying the task at hand.  

Time Boxing is a period of time where a person works towards completing a goal for an allotted time. Once the time limit is over, the person assesses if they have accomplished the goal. The Pomodoro Technique is a version of time boxing. In the Pomodoro Technique, a person would work for 25 minutes on a specific project or goal, and then take a five-minute break. The goal is to work on a specific task without being sidetracked or procrastinate and helps a person focus longer. I could use this this technique during phase 0 when completing a specific task. Rather than jumping from project to project, this will help me complete the task at hand.

Currently, I use my Google calendar to help organize my day. I have specific time-blocks for breaks, working out or physical activity, and doing work. My strategy did work because it helped me get into a specific mindset during that allotted time. It also gave me mental breaks because I know I can only work for three hours at a time. However, I plan on incorporating the Pomodoro Technique into Phase 0 as described above. I will also create small goals for the weak so I can build my confidence in the world of coding. Since I do not have a full time job at the moment, I will get in a routine by sticking to a schedule and being diligent. I plan on doing phase 0 tasks in the morning, workout during lunch time to give myself a mental break, coach tennis, and work on phase 0 tasks in the evening/night time. 
## 1.2 The Command Line
A shell is simply a program that reads and executes commands from your keyboard. You can create files, move directories, and do perform numerous commands in the shell. The “bash” is the specific version of a shell. In Linux and Unix, we are using the “bash” version of the shell. There are other different shells available as well.

I have typed these commands before when following tutorials to modify my android phones and Amazon FireTV. However, I never completely understood what they did. Going through the material solidified my understanding of the different commands. Some of the commands I already knew, but some of the other commands were foreign to me. The most challenging aspect was attempting to memorize all of the commands, and combining them. In addition, getting used to typing out everything without the GUI was challenging at times too. I know most of the basic commands, but need to work on the more advanced commands such as grep. I was able to visualize how directories work in my head. I was able to successfully use most of the commands; however, I had trouble moving a file from the desktop to the temp directory.

I think cd, mkdir, and rmdir are important commands to know because you are able to change directories and create/delete directories as well. Being able to navigate directories is important because I believe we will be working with many different directories. Also, the command grep is important too because I believe we will be searching through different sections of the file.

- pwd – prints the directory or folder you are currently in on the command line
- ls – lists out all of the content of the directory you are in
- mv – moves, copies, or renames a file or directory 
- cd – use this command to change directories
- ../ - move up or down in the directory
- touch – create new, empty files
- mkdir – makes a new directory inside the current directory or folder
- less – searches through a file
- rmdir – removes a directory 
- rm – removes a specific file
- help – use this command to access help for specific commands
