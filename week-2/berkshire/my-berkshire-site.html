<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

-The experience was good. My pair helped me navigate through the commands if I forgot one. I think the tags were pretty straight forward, but I definitely have to memorize the tags more. I think it was helpful having a navigator as he was able to research certain commands if we did not remember. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

- Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements was challenging at times. There is plenty of information out there, but as I read more, I was able to understand the differences between HTML4 and HTML5. We were able to use the HTML5 tags in our website and divided the page using the <div> tags. We were able to use different tags such as the <p> tag to denote a new paragraph, the <a href="url"></a> to hyperlink a word or phrase, <ul> tags to create an unordered list, and the <li> tag for the list items themselves. We understood the concept of nesting and were able to do it with relative ease. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

-We kept our HTML formatting very simple. We did not change any fonts, sizes, colors, or background because that is bad practice in HTML. Essentially, we set up the skeleton of the HTML page. We divided the page when we needed to and create new paragraphs to signify a split. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

-HTML seems like it is great for page structure. As mentioned above, it is not good practice to format in HTML. It appears that "bad websites" might use HTML to format their pages. I like how mostly every tag has an opening and closing tag. This makes it easy to track errors if something seems wrong with your page. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

-I like the tree structure of HTML. It helps to remember the basics of HTML and then all of the other tags go within those tags. Obviously, repetition is a key factor in remembering how to write HTML. However, another factor is familiarizing myself with HTML by looking at the source code of websites. It'll give me a better idea of what good code for HTML is.
