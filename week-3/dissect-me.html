<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

This challenge proved to be a bit difficult because of my computer problems and jsfiddle not working at first. However, my pair was able to work through the problem with me as well as my guide. I used the main, header, article, section, aside, and footer tags in this challenge. This helps me and other readers divide the pages into clearer sections instead of using the div tags only. Using these tags help signify different portions of the document and establish a hierarchy. In addition, many of the tags can be nested within each other to help distinguish different sections. 

The way the elements get laid out into the page is like a tree-like structure. There always needs to be a <!DOCTYPE html>, an <html>, a <head>, <title> within the head, and a <body> tag. Usually elements have two matching tags, an opening tag, and a closing tag. Many elements can contain other elements within them, as in you can nest other elements inside one another. The way the browser dispalys the elements is through the hierarchal structure of your page. The browser will read the tags and all of the tags nested within the main tags. 

I learned that you can create snippets or layouts for your page. We learned how to create an HTML template and saving it for future use. This saves a lot of time when creating an HTML document. Instead of typing all of the required tags in, you can hit html tab to autopopulate your sublime page. I will definitely create more snippets later to help me become more efficient.
