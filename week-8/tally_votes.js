/*
What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

This challenge was hard. It took us about 5 hours to complete. I would show the initial solution, but it is so messy that I decided to take it out.
We learned a lot about in this challenge. Learned how to access nested objects using the for...in loop and using multiple for in loops. I learned 
how to use the bracket notation to access nested objects. 

No, we were not able to find any useful methods. 

Iterating over nested objects were solidified, although I can't say I am an expert at it just yet. It took us a long time.
