# Drawer Debugger

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Original Code

class Drawer

  attr_reader :contents

# Are there any more methods needed in this class?

  def initialize
    @contents = []

  end

  def open
    @open = true
  end

  def close
    @open = false
  end

  def add_item(item)
    @contents << item
  end

  def remove_item(item = @contents.pop) #what is `#pop` doing?
   @contents.delete(item)
  end

  def dump 
    @contents.clear
    puts "Your drawer is empty."
  end

  def view_contents
    puts "The drawer contains:"
    @contents.each {|silverware| puts "- " + silverware.type }
  end

end

class Silverware
  attr_reader :type

# Are there any more methods needed in this class?

  def initialize(type, clean = true)
    @type = type
    @clean = clean
  end

  def eat
    puts "eating with the #{type}"
    @clean = false
  end
  
  def clean
    @clean = true

end

# What will you need here in order to remove a spoon? You may modify the driver code for this error.

# Reflection

=begin
What concepts did you review in this challenge?
What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

We reviewed classes and driver code. 

I think just reading someone else's code takes some time but it's a lot easier than writing your own code. I'm gonna 
work on some inheritance I believe.

I'm going to review some nested hashes and arrays. Hashes are a bit harder to coneptulaize for me.
